Likhet kan studeres for eksempel ved å se på utdannelse, formue eller inntekt, yrke, makt, prestisje, betingelser for arbeid og fritid, tilgang til tjenester, og sosiale relasjoner. Marginalisering og sosial eksklusjon kan være et resultat av ugunstige forhold på flere områder i livet, og mennesker det gjelder kan bli fratatt rettigheter, muligheter, ressurser og sosial integrering. Eksempler på data: Statistikk over inntekt og likhet, oppfattelsen av gruppefokusert diskriminering (for eksempel mot innvandrere, hjemløse, asylsøkere); oppfattelsen av forskjeller mellom menn og kvinner når det gjelder mulighet for ledende politiske roller; innvirkningen av foreldres arbeidsløshet på barns utdanningsnivå og sosiale nettverk.",
